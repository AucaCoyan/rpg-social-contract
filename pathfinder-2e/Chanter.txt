# Chanter

Chanters can be found in almost any culture, but are most often seen in communities with a strong oral tradition. They are repositories of folk knowledge and common wisdom, tellers of tall tales and hallowed legends. They use these stories and legends to stir the memories of the dreaming lost souls and soul fragments that surround them. The spirits respond by creating magical effects, essentially playing their part in the recreation of the legends. In this way, chanters act as directors of supernatural actors playing out momentary plays for the chanter's benefit.


They are storytellers and repositories of ancient lore from myriad cultural traditions. While they have some minor talent in traditional arts of combat and soul-based magic, their true power lies in their chants and invocations. They construct chants from individual iconic phrases, through the clever overlapping of phrases, chanters can grant their allies a sizable stack of minor bonuses over large area. While chants may seem modest compared to a wizard or a priest magic, chanters are able to recite their chants while occupied with other activities, making them extremely versatile.
