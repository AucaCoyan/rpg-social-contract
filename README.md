Verum Rules
This article is being reorganized to consolidate information. This process is WIP.

Hover over the CODEX tab on the left to display the Table of Contents.

BEFORE PLAYING
Perhaps the most important aspect of the Living World of Verum is the various rule systems that allow a sense of progression, structure, and direction. There are specific systems taken from other gaming systems, modified systems from basic D&D 5e, and completely homebrewed rules that must be learned and understood in order to progress meaningfully in this world.

If you want to just sign-up as a player and not deal with any of the homebrew details right now, then you can skip to Joining Verum below and follow the directions there.

However, for the purposes of just creating and playing a character in Verum, it is highly advised you tackle the information starting from the Playing the Game section before you play in your first game, as certain factors and mechanics are significantly different from traditional 5e.

Joining Verum
In order to play in the Living World of Verum, you must join the community as a player or as a dungeon master. If you wish to join as a player, you must:
Be subscribed to Arcadum's twitch channel
Have a World Anvil account (the platform you're reading this article on)
If you fulfill the above, then you can sign-up with a character submission during an open character wave. How many players Verum can support is proportionate to how many dungeon masters are available to run games, so sometimes character submissions are open, sometimes they are closed. If submissions are closed, you will have to wait until the next wave or sign-up as a dungeon master.

Joining as a Player
If you wish to submit a character during an open wave, you must fill out an application in the #character-submissions channel in the Verum Discord with the information below. Details regarding race, class, origin, factions, etc., you can read further in Character Creation.
Discord Name:
World Anvil Username:
Character Name:
Race:
Class:
Origin:
Sub-Origin:
1st Faction Choice:
2nd Faction Choice:
3rd Faction Choice:
Deity:
You may only play one character in Verum at a time.

Retiring a Character
If you wish to play a new character before your current one has died, you must retire them from adventuring. You do not control your character once they've retired. You may write roleplaying posts for narrative purposes on your character exiting from the adventurer's life, but as is with backstory, actions beyond their scope are not canon. You can read further about roleplaying in Roleplaying and about backstory in Backstory.

When you're ready to play a new character, whatever the reason, you must fill out the above application and post it in #character-submissions again for the new character. If you wish to retire your character and make a new one right away, add "(retiring [character name])" below the information in your post.

If you do retire, it is common courtesy to inform your faction's chapter master. If you're unable to decide on what character to play next but still want to as soon as you figure it out, you must still at least inform a Political DM that your latest character is retiring. If you do not plan to play a new character in Verum for a while, but still wish to be a player in Verum, you can inform a Political DM you are going on hiatus. You can read further about this in Hiatus.

If you are planning on retiring and you want to trade your character's items, you must either deposit them into your faction bank if you are in a faction, or trade them to other players. You can read further about this in Trading. You can not trade items to others with the intent of getting them back for your next character. The only way for you to pass items directly to your next character when retiring is through Progeny, which you can read further about in Marriage.

Joining as a DM
If you become a dungeon master, you are automatically allowed to be a player. However, dungeon masters are vetted, so you will have to go through the process of learning how to run games for Verum by the Training department first. To sign-up to become a dungeon master, you must fill out an application in the #dungeon-master-applications channel in the Verum discord. Doing so will require you to fill out the following information:
Discord Name:
Years of DnD experience:
Years of 5e experience:
Availability to run games:
Experience with Maptools:
Experience with online DM'ing:
Your level of comfort being streamed:
Your Twitch name:
Are you one of the Seven?:
Why do you want to be a DM for Verum? What do you believe you bring to the table?:
Once your application has been looked over and approved, the Training DMs will contact you and explain how to proceed. Besides always have a character slot open to you, DMs may choose to enjoy a slight boost to character progression speed over other players, as compensation for running games or writing content for Verum. You can learn more about this as you become a DM.
Maptools
The Living World of Verum uses MapTools as its main platform for running sessions. You can download this program here.

Character Tokens
If you are new to D&D, you will need to create a token that represents your character for use in MapTools. An easy to use program for creating a character token is TokenTool. Below is a step-by-step guide to creating your token with TokenTool.
Install and open TokenTool
Click and drag the image you want to use onto the left, bigger side of the window
Choose a frame, zoom, pan, and utilize the other options to your liking
Use Save As to save the token image, or if MapTools is already open, you can click and drag the image in the right, smaller window to the Maptools playing area, which will automatically create the token for you
You can also create a token in MapTools by clicking and dragging the token image file from its directory in your computer to the MapTools playing area
Once the token is in MapTools, you can edit the token's properties and macros as appropriate for your character
The #maptool-help channel in the Verum discord explains further how to edit your token for Verum
Save the token by right-clicking it and selecting Save... This will save all edits associated with that token
When you join games from now on, you need only click and drag the saved token file (not the image like in step 4) to MapTools - it is the file with the .rptok extension.

Joining a Session in MapTools
With MapTools open, click File, then Connect to Server. How you will connect from this point is dependent on the DM running your game. If you're not sure how to proceed, make sure to ask them.
Scheduling
The scheduling process for Verum is mostly handled by Scheduling DMs.

The two important links you need to keep are:
The Scheduling Master spreadsheet
and
The Player Submission for Games form
As Dungeon Masters submit games to run, they will appear in the Pending Games tab of the spreadsheet. Here, you can learn about the game in the tab:
Its name,
Recommended level,
Etc. Generally, around Thursday, the Scheduling DM will announce that the Player Submission for Games form has been updated. You then have until the following Sunday at 10 pm CST to use the form to sign-up for games. You are allowed to make only one submission for each game you wish to join. Sunday, the Scheduling DM will sort players into games, and announce who is playing when in the #pending-game-channel in the Verum discord.

By default, every player is able to play in a session every two weeks, with a few exceptions described in Sessions and Missions. Signing up for games in back-to-back weeks puts you lower in priority to be chosen than another who has not played in the weeks prior to this. If you retire your character and create a new one while scheduled for a mission, you give up your slot in that mission — it does not carry over between characters (it's metagaming if it did).

Make sure to check the pins in the #player-scheduling as well, as certain questions or nuances about scheduling are addressed in there. You can also ask questions regarding scheduling and signing-up for games in that channel.

Every player has a 15-minute buffer for lateness. If you are late to a scheduled game for 15-minutes or longer the DM will replace you with another—appropriately—leveled character.

You can read further about game sessions in Sessions and Missions.
Grace
If you're an adventurer and your subscription to Arcadum has run out, you will be placed in Grace. When in Grace, you have until the first Sunday of the next month to re-subscribe and maintain your character and slot in the Living World. This grace period can be extended by the Admins or Arcadum for any reason to give players more leniency (IE: Covid-19 or sub running out at the end of the month).

Only Admins will contact you about your grace status. If someone other than an admin is contacting you about your grace status, please contact an administrator.

Hiatus
Some players may not have the time to spend to RP or play in Verum due to life commitments. If this comes to be you can inform a Political DM you are going on hiatus, or you are automatically given this status after a month of inactivity. Your character is removed from its faction and goes to a pool of characters that can rejoin at the beginning of the next phase without giving up your character slot or the rest of that character's details; level, inventory, faction loyalty, etc. Upon your return, you are re-added to your faction if there is room. Otherwise, you stay as factionless without taking the exit penalties. If you have not returned from hiatus by the next phase and after the one month grace period your character is retired, and your character slot revoked. You'll have to rejoin Verum as any new player would. Should you return from hiatus before the next phase, you can retire the character and make a new one to play right away.
Players in the military may rejoin at any time.

You can read further about factions in the Factions section.

Should a player go on hiatus whose character is involved in significant narrative roleplay, a DM will RP that character to the best of their ability to resolve the situation.

Should you wish to go on hiatus for an amount of time on the grounds of preserving your mental health or other similar circumstances, you must appeal to the Discipline Admin (Crystal) in a private message. If you are in good standing in Verum, your hiatus will be allowed and you will be able to leave from the server without losing your character. Once you return, should there be a character slot available and if a long time skip has not occurred since going on hiatus, you will be able to return to your character.
Roleplaying
A large portion of the content that Verum provides takes place in the Verum community discord. This content consists of roleplaying and in order to achieve the fairest and most enjoyable roleplaying environment for our players, there are several rules to be aware of when participating.

There are five environments in which roleplay occurs:
Faction Channels
Open RP Areas
Prestige Events
World Events
Campaign Events
Each one has unique properties that will be gone over in their respective sections, though they all share very important basic rules.

General Roleplay and Formatting
Change your discord nickname to [character name] ([discord alias]).
Example: Doe John (Average Guy) - Doe John is the character name, Average Guy is the discord name.
These names can be abbreviated if you go over Discord's 32 character limit, but they must remain reasonably recognizable, no memes.
If you are Staff or a DM, NPCs you play as must have the name of the NPC either within your nickname or noted down at the top of your post as the NPC.
You can only have a maximum of 2 emojis in your nickname if you are an adventurer, staff, DM, or Admin. This can be temporarily voided with permission from the admins if you have a valid reason to use more than 2 emojis in your nickname.
Use quotation marks to speak in character.
Example: "I'm rather intrigued to discover that my opponent, who looks likes a perfectly civilized person, is in fact mathematically capable."
Use normal text to describe scenes, appearances, and actions.
The standard format for this is to italicize the text, which you do by placing a single asterisk around what is not spoken.
Example: *He stared at the man across from him and squinted with distaste.* "All these statistics and where does it get you?" *he asked rhetorically.*
becomes
He stared at the man across from him and squinted with distaste. "All these statistics and where does it get you?" he asked rhetorically.
Other formatting options in discord include:
Placing double asterisks [**] around the text bolds it.
Placing triple asterisks [***] around the text bolds and italicizes it.
Placing double underscores [ __ ] around the text underlines it.
Placing double tildes [ ~~ ] around the text strikes through it.
Placing a single greater-than sign [ > ] as the first character in a line of text gives it a simple quote-like format (you'll have to see for yourself).
It is recommended to use discord's tagging function [@] to tag players or characters who are relevant to your roleplaying. This is to ensure that they see your post and do not lose the flow, especially when there are multiple players roleplaying in the same channel.
All roleplaying is in character. If you want to type something in a roleplaying channel that is out of character, use paratheses ( ) around it. However, excessive out of character (OoC) typing should be relegated elsewhere, such as the #living-world-oorc channel in the Verum discord.
Erotic roleplaying (ERP) and crimes of an exceedingly violent or sexual nature are forbidden from being performed. If you're not sure if something you're doing qualifies here, do not post it.
You can read more about player behavior in the Player Behavior and Discipline section.
You can reflavor abilities or appearances, or give unique flairs to something for your character, but these are merely for dramatization - it does not mechanically benefit your character, ever.
You control only your character in roleplay. You cannot dictate the actions of another player's character, ever.
Example: I reach out with a dagger threateningly towards the man, causing him to shake with fear. - Stating "causing him to quake with fear" is prohibited, because it is the other player controlling that man that decides to act fearful, not you.
Most non-player characters (NPC) you cannot control either, but there are some exceptions:
You can control familiars, animal companions, and pets your character possesses.
You can read further about animal companions and pets in Pet and Mount Rules.
If an NPC is significantly associated with your character, such as an NPC spouse of your character, you may roleplay that NPC only with the permission of the DM that created them. To reiterate, do not control them unless you have asked and received explicit permission from that NPC's creative DM.
If you do receive permission, be very reserved with what they are capable of doing. Using NPCs you control to propagate sensitive information is potentially metagaming. You can read further about this in the Metagaming section.
NPCs that have been created as a part of your character's background cannot be controlled either. You can read further about this in Backstory.
You can roleplay in only one channel at a time.
If your character travels from one location to another - moving to a different channel to roleplay - you must designate your character's exit of a channel with a post before arriving at the new one with an **Exit**. The post does not need to be descriptive (though it is encouraged), stating **Exit** and leaving the channel is fine.
Any roleplay that occurs outside of the Verum discord and that is not witnessed by an unimplicated DM is not canon.
Example: If you private message another player in discord and state "I reveal all my faction's secrets to you," without a DM present to approve it, then it never happened. Attempting to act in-character based on this, from either player, is metagaming.
If you wish to have a private conversation with another player, such as addressing political agendas, you can tag Political in your relevant roleplay post to request one. An available Political DM will invite you and the involved players to a private server to carry the conversation.
If ever you are in doubt, ask a DM.

Player versus Player (PvP)
Players will inevitably be antagonistic against others, so PvP is an allowed action in Verum. Due to its seriousness, the following rules are in place addressing it:
PvP does not require consent from all involved parties to occur.
Unless the involved parties decide to make the PvP non-lethal, player characters can die through PvP.
A DM who is not implicated in the PvP is required to witness and resolve it. If one is not available when PvP would initiate, it and the involved parties are RP Locked until one is.
You can read further about this in the RP Lock section below.
The DM will create a combat map in Maptools, start a server, and the involved parties are brought in to perform the PvP. The involved parties may request the DM to have the PvP be done with text in the discord channel, but the DM makes the final decision.
Be aware that the DM may have outsiders become involved with the encounter, such as random nearby creatures, town guards, NPC faction members coming to the defense of an involved party, etc.

Faction Roleplay
Each faction in Verum has its own allocated channel for roleplaying between its members and important NPCs. The faction has one of five states that determines its availability to players outside the faction, decided by the respective faction's chapter master.
Open: Any player may visit and roleplay at any time.
Neutral: Only those who are members of the faction, allies of the faction, and the factionless may RP here.
Defensive: Only those who are members of the faction and allies of the faction may RP here.
Restricted: Only those who are members of the faction or invited by the Chapter Master may RP here.
Closed: Only the faction's members may roleplay.
When the faction is Neutral or Defensive, the Chapter Master may grant permission to any person or persons (not exceeding 3 people), to enter the faction if they do not meet the regular requirements. When a faction has an in-character meeting, a Political DM is required to be present to take notes of the relevant information. Anything that occurs in a faction meeting without a Political DM is not canon.

You can read further about factions in the Factions section.

Open RP
Open RP areas are locations scattered across the game world that have no faction affiliation. The purpose of these locations is to be free and open to interactions between all sorts for roleplaying, though they still adhere to the General Roleplay Rules.

Since these Open RP locations can include a variety of opportunities for roleplaying, it is good etiquette to wait at least two hours since the last post has been made to change the roleplaying scene in the channel to one of your preference — as appropriate for the channel you're in. If any conflicts arise from scene changing, notify a DM to resolve it. While you ultimately have control over your character's action, carrying out illegal acts, such as theft or assault, will mark you as a criminal, bandit, blacklisted, or similar if the proper authorities become aware of it.

There are several open RP areas in every region of the continent. Most have some kind of pre-determined association, such as with a certain class, deity of worship, or a purpose of society, and may limit entry based on these associations. The channel descriptions elaborate on these associations and describe the area. However, the two channels below are open to all by default:
The World Road | #the-world-road
This channel is not tied to a particular region but is found in all regions as a series of roads that connect them. The World Road is managed by the World Wanderers (the organization beyond the player faction), and typical scenes are campsite meetings, road-side interactions, etc.
The Proving Ground | #the-proving-ground
This channel is in the Daborak region and is an arena where any may come to participate in competitive combat. The Proving Ground is owned and managed by Iltanen Oronoscorenzie, a famous combatant, and typical scenes are duels in the arena, conversations in the surrounding stands, etc.
An RP Event DM may host a roleplaying event in any of these open RP areas with time-sensitive participation. Such events are usually announced in advance, but when transpiring, they are frequently RP Locked.

Marriage
A marriage is, in the mortal's view, a contract of love and binding of souls; this is true to a fuller extent than most realize. The deities of Verum care very much about marriage as it has a narrative weight. Whether it be the absolute profession of love or the power of the oath itself, many deities benefit from the fact that two souls bound together have more impact than two souls separated. As such, the following rules are in place to explain how things work in marriage:
Getting Married
Regardless of culture, marriage is a combining of two souls. These souls do not need to be in love, but they both must agree to a ceremony. The reason for the ceremony does not matter, but they must agree to it. Although it is extremely rare, the indirect forcing of marriage has occurred before.
Betrothals are not an exception, and they can cause some serious indirect pressure.
A cleric of any deity may perform the ceremony in dedication to any deity on the request of those to be married. However, it should be noted that the cleric in charge of the ceremony has the final say. Some clerics may refuse to do a ceremony if they do not agree with the request.
A marriage can only be between two souls. This does not mean the relationship must be monogamous, it simply means only two souls can be combined. There are cosmological reasons for this.
Mechanical Effects
The bonus to AC effect of marriage from the Ceremony spell is permanent.
Whenever two souls are conjoined in marriage, the highest prestige among them is used for both characters.
You can read further about this in Prestige.
Divorce
Marriage is considered to be an oath from a mechanical stance. Unlike other oaths, marriages can be annulled by one person rather than requiring both.
To divorce a marriage, you are required to seek out a cleric of Viderick or Babylon (this does not have to be a player). The oath is then nullified, not broken.
You can read further about these two in Religion.
If you seek a marriage between two player characters to be annulled so that you can marry again, you must seek atonement and wait at least 1 year of time in-character. This wait period does not apply to characters married to pure NPCs, but does apply if they are married to an NPC who was once a player character.
This restriction on marriage after divorce can be lifted due to extraneous out-of-character reason, such as harassment or coercion using progeny, at the discretion of the Marriage department given ample and suitable evidence.
You cannot force someone to stay in marriage by declining their desire for a divorce.

You can read further about oaths in Oaths.

Progeny
Children of player characters are to be tracked through the Marriage DMs. Player and non-player children can benefit, but only in limited fashions. There are no other progeny relations allowed at this time.

The benefits that a child receives must be for a child that is documented and tracked by the Marriage DMs, and only one child from any pairing can receive these benefits.

Below are the tiers of progeny. All requirements and benefits are cumulative.
Tier 1
Requirement: The child is a documented child of the parents
The child may receive 50 gp per level of the highest level character. The gold must be possessed by the character.
Tier 2
Requirement: The child is the result of a player x player character marriage. Children of retired player characters are still considered in this tier.
The child may inherit a magic item with limitations.
Tier 3
Requirement: If a parent has at least 4 prestige, then the marriage bond will create a noble house.
The child receives half of the prestige of the parents.
A new origin representing the noble bloodline is created for the child.
A couple that is unable to, or does not wish to have progeny through normal means of pregnancy, has the following option:
Seek a Cleric of Viderick (does not have to be a player character) to have the ritual of birth be performed to have the essence of their souls be combined to birth a child.
This ritual of birth takes as long to come to fruition as the race’s typical gestation does. While the ritual is cast instantly, the baby will appear at the site of the ritual after the gestation period. It is recommended to perform this in a safe, comfortable place for the newborn child.

Mothers have a +2 bonus to AC while pregnant. It is assumed the mother will not put their unborn child at risk by continuing to adventure in life-threatening situations, but mothers in Verum have this defensive boon to protect the soul within.

When the child is born, the parent holding the child also receives this bonus of +2 to their AC. This and the prior listed AC bonus do not stack with multiple children. The child is not an object, and exploiting this will dip into forbidden actions and punishment will be dealt if you are found to be using children in a distasteful manner. Bringing a child into a mission can, and likely will, also be treated in the same manner.

Children cannot use magic until maturity. This is to prevent issues regarding hostile actions and being unable to be harmed due to forbidden actions.

Couples that wish to do the dirty, so to speak, and not have children are capable of doing so, as protection exists.

You can read further about forbidden actions in Forbidden Actions.

Prestige, Campaign, and World Events
These events are situations that generally take place before, or as a result of, a significant event in Verum. What the event is about, who can participate, and when it will be run is usually explained in advanced by a DM. These events are more likely than most to have important consequences, perhaps even dangerous ones. Due to the significant nature of these events, they will almost always have a dedicated channel for roleplaying in them.

DM Intervention
Should a DM intervene in roleplay, or simply in conversation, they will typically use a formatting technique referred to as “bars”. These bars are meant to organize and separate instances of roleplay that require a DMs input.
Double Bars: (===========)
These bars indicate a full stop in roleplay. Once these have been placed in a chat, no further messages should be sent without a Dungeon Master’s further instruction.
Single bars: (----------)
These bars are typically used to section off instances of roleplay while the Double Bars are in effect. Most normally they are used to separate roleplay from dice rolls in the same chat. After these bars are posted the DM will typically ask for a certain action to be performed, or for an ability to be rolled.
Discord Moderators will also use these bars when necessary.

Forbidden Actions
Forbidden Actions are those you cannot take in-character, for any reason. If your proposed action has something to do with the actions described below and you start your sentence with, "what if?" or similar wording to produce the same effect, you are wrong. If you falsely accuse someone of such acts, or if you try to claim them in a manner seen to troll or manipulate a situation, you will be punished as if you had committed them yourself. You can read further about this in Player Behavior and Discipline.

These subjects exist in the world just like in our own, but the point is that they are not described nor depicted for the sake of all of our player's and DM's peace of mind.

Sexual Assault
You may not attempt to sexually assault another character, ever. It does not matter if the players involved are fine with it, they and you will not participate in it. If it is done privately, do not reference it in public or use it in any way to impact other characters. With player permission, less egregious acts may be performed, such as a classy touch, hand grab, shoulder rub, etc. Romance and pursuing it is fine, but groping is where the line is drawn.
Torture
You may not torture another character, player or NPC. This includes but is not limited to physical, mental, or spiritual torture. Social interrogation and general trickery of a less extreme nature are permissible.
Child Death
You may not harm a true child, ever. Disasters, NPC enemies, sickness, and such dangers exist, but their use for the narrative is handled solely, and strictly, by the DMs.
Suicide
Players may not kill their characters through suicide. They cannot threaten to do so, they can not say they will do so. If your character would get to the point they will, then retire. Retiring in this way is not a substitute for death. No suicide. Heroic self sacrifice does not fall under this forbidden action.
Phobias
This one is not as serious as the other four, but you must still adhere to good practice when utilizing these. If you roleplay a character that contains heavy symbology, reference or intensity with a common phobia, it is best to warn the players present so that they can look away or remove themselves. As long as some form of communication is attempted and none involved are trying to control the actions of others with this rule, then it is fair play. Any attempt to metagame this rule for a mechanical or roleplay advantage, or to exploit a player, will result in your removal.
Examples of common phobias:
Arachnophobia (spiders)
Aerophobia (flying)
Trypophobia (clusters of holes)
Ophidiophobia (snakes)
Cynophobia (dogs)
Thalassophobia (deep water)
Trypanophobia (needles)
Coulrophobia (clowns)
Metagaming
Metagaming is when a player uses their out-of-character knowledge to determine their character's actions, even though the character has no relevant knowledge or awareness of its details. There are different levels of severity to metagaming, some of it harmless, but it is inevitable to happen one way or another. The best we can do is mitigate it and the consequences.

Due to the inherent nature of Verum, with many players in many factions, political intrigue plays a part; secret information is held and protected by many characters. Since it is possible a player is able to read and make conjectures on what is said in the various channels when their own character isn't present, then there's always a risk that information influences that player's decisions. Just like there's a risk that a player privately messages another player to further an agenda. As safe as players may try to be when being underhanded, there's nothing the DMs haven't seen before.

So, do not have your character act in a way that is not consistent with the character's established persona or their knowledge. It's as simple as that.
Player Behavior and Discipline
This system is meant to punish any person (regardless of authority) for extensively breaking Verum rules, instigating adverse conflict, and/or breaking Discord Terms of Service. The list below serves as an insight into examples and definitions of some of the offenses with rough categorizations on their levels of severity. However, actions that require judgment will be interpreted based on the evidence at our disposal. When someone commits misconduct, relative disciplinary action will be taken against them. Though, as the server owner, Arcadum reserves the right to remove any user from the server at any time—for any reason.

The main people in charge of discipline are the moderators, admins — particularly the Discipline admin — and Arcadum. When an offense is made aware, the moderators will question the involved parties and review evidence. If, after deliberation, discipline is found warranted it is brought before Arcadum who confirms the decision and the severity of the punishment. Offenses committed are tracked.

If you're ever unsure that something you may do may warrant discipline, it's in your best interest to not commit to it without speaking with a moderator first. If you wish to report someone else breaking a rule, alert a moderator, do not purposefully instigate controversy over it in public. If you wish to report anonymously, you may do so, but be aware that it can limit the context of the report and evidence. You can either ask another player or the moderator to report the information anonymously, or you can follow the directions in the #report-box channel in the Verum discord.

If you have any questions about this system, feel free to message a moderator.

Sessions and Missions
Verum is structured around a system of D&D game sessions that take place on a weekly basis. Between these sessions, players are welcome to partake in the vast range of roleplaying that goes on in the Verum discord. The true consequences of one's actions take place in this roleplaying environment, though it could not function without the core content that is the D&D games. This core content follows a leveling system that rewards milestones known as Mission Value, which you can read further about in Character Experience.

In contrast from a session, which is the typical 4-hour play session between a party and the DM, a Mission is a more focused representation of the party's objective. A mission can span one or multiple sessions, but all in the effort of completing that overarching mission. There are default estimations of rewards for completing a mission, depending on its number of sessions and the rate of difficulty. Thus, higher difficulties and higher numbers of sessions generally equate to better rewards upon completing the mission.

For scheduling, missions are broadly categorized into Standard and Special types. You can be scheduled for only one standard and one special mission at the same time if you are not RP Locked, explained further in RP Lock. Thus, as an example you can be in both a prestige mission and a standard mission, but not in two standard missions or both a prestige and company mission.

In the case where a DM needs a replacement for a game and doesn't have the luxury of time, they may seek a player substitute even if they've already played that week.

Tiers of Play
The tiers of play are categories that separate mission types and difficulty based upon character level. Due to the nature of the game, there is some overlap between the different types, or occasionally a DM may break the standard level range for a particular reason. The tiers of play are as follows:
Standard Missions
Tier 1 | Levels 1 - 4
Minor Missions
These are the standard mission type for tier 1 or 2 of play, but often tier 1, with 1-2 planned session. Completion rewards no extra MV.
Tier 2 | Levels 5 - 8
Lesser Missions
These are the standard mission type for tier 2 of play, but can be played at tier 1 or rarely at tier 3, with 3-4 planned sessions. Completion rewards 2 extra MV.
Major Missions
These are the high-end mission type for tier 2 of play, but can be played at tier 3 as well, with 4-6 planned sessions. Completion rewards 4 extra MV.
Tier 3 | Levels 9 - 12
Greater Missions
These are the high-end mission type for tier 3 of play, with 7-9 planned sessions. Completion rewards 8 extra MV.
Tier 4 | Levels 13 - 15
TBD
Tier 5 | Levels 16 - 17
TBD
Tier 6 | Levels 18 - 19
TBD
Tier 7 | Level 20
TBD
Special Missions
Prestige Mission
These missions include all tiers of play but at increased difficulties. Prestige missions have focused objectives, and even greater rewards - chief among them Prestige, diamond dust, more powerful items, and divine boons. They have no set session limit, though they are more likely to be one session than multiple.
Unlike standard scheduling, players are intended to meet, discuss, and arrange their parties with some agency. Each prestige mission has a unique objective and may have priorities that differ in their broadness (some are specific, others less so). The players are welcome to select their prestige missions based on the objectives and priorities. Typically, a channel in the discord is created and used to serve as the hub to track the narrative set-up, any disclosed information, and RP between players looking to join.
You can read further about the prestige mechanic in Prestige.
Company Mission
These missions are those that are reserved specifically for Companies, a sort of small-scale group formed between players. These missions provide rewards unique to companies, will have higher difficulties compared to standard missions and are likely to break tier of play due to companies having players in different level ranges.
You can read further about this in Companies.
Campaigns
These missions start at tier 2 of play but can be played in all tiers beyond. Campaigns are multiple session missions that occur as a result of the grand, culminating narrative across the Verum world. As such, they usually focus on the higher leveled characters and are ran by Arcadum himself or designated out to a trusted DM. Campaigns can award one flat prestige gain upon completion, but are are considered normal missions for the purposes of being scheduled into a prestige or company mission.

RP Lock
RP Lock also applies missions, as a condition where you are limited in your contact with the world outside of your mission and your current party. While in a mission that is RP Locked, you:
Can not spend Downtime or Crafting Days, but they accrue with each weekly reset and do not expire like normal. When you return from your RP lock mission, these backlogged days become available for you to spend and do not expire until a number of weeks pass equal to how many weeks you spent in the RP lock. This accrual of days also applies to Inventory Lock, which is functionally similar with the exception that it only prevents your inventory from changing, still allowing you to RP freely.
May use time-sensitive downtime activities, such as purchasing crafting materials or special crafters from the Great Bazaar, and purchasing items from the Prestige Shop can still be done when RP locked. Things you purchase in these ways are not available to your character until the RP locked mission is complete.
You can read further about the above two points in the Downtime section.
Can not add in or take out things in your character's inventory from outside the mission, with the exception of gold or crafting tokens for time-sensitive activities mentioned above.
May send messages to the outside world via spells like Sending and Animal Messenger, or through a courier if your DM allows it. Messages can not be sent or received if you are engaged in combat between sessions.
May level up between sessions of a mission if you take a long rest at the end of the session in which you would level up.
You can read further above leveling up in the Character Experience section.
Character Experience
If you are familiar with D&D, or even RPGs at all, then you're most likely aware of the concept of using "experience" to represent a character's growth. In order to smooth the leveling process for players, experience is not earned based on creature kills like in traditional D&D instead it's rewarded for completing missions. The term used in Verum is Mission Value, or MV for short.

The amount of MV awarded for each session is 1 by default at the end of each session. More is awarded for completing a mission based on its difficulty and tier of play, as seen in Tiers of Play. This mission completion reward is only received at the end of the mission, and only to those characters that participated in more than half of the sessions. For example, in a 4 session Major Mission, you must participate in at least three of the sessions - more than half - to be rewarded with the extra 4 MV for mission completion. A 2 session mission would thus require you participating in both.
You do not need to be in the last session to get completion rewards. If the mission is failed, there is no completion reward, and any remaining MV for unplayed sessions are forfeit.

A character levels up when they've earned their current level in MV, starting from level 1. For example, a level 2 character must earn 2 MV to level up to 3, and then earn 3 MV to level up to 4, and so on. Below is a list showing a character’s total MV to level ratio.
1st Level = 0 MV
2nd Level = 1 MV
3rd Level = 3 MV
4th Level = 6 MV
5th Level = 10 MV
6th Level = 15 MV
7th Level = 21 MV
8th Level = 28 MV
9th Level = 36 MV
10th Level = 45 MV
11th Level = 55 MV
12th Level = 66 MV
13th Level = 78 MV
14th Level = 91 MV
15th Level = 105 MV
16th Level = 120 MV
17th Level = 136 MV
18th Level = 153 MV
19th Level = 171 MV
20th Level = 190 MV
Prestige
Prestige is a mechanic similar to reputation, but there is more nuance to it. It is a numerical representation of your character's fame and influence, as well as other narrative factors.

The amount of Prestige corresponds to the difficulty of a mission. Players also need specific amounts of Prestige to embark on personal quests, unlock exclusive privileges (like Exotic pets) and to measure their characters’ impact on Verum.

Prestige can be earned in different ways outside of missions, which generally amount to performing heroic actions, going above and beyond expectations. Such situations can be matters of life and death, requiring you to take a gamble.
Still, the standard method is to complete prestige missions. Each prestige mission will have a prestige number associated with it, such as a Prestige 3 Mission. You earn prestige from completing the mission if this number is higher than your character's current prestige. Thus, your character would need 2 or less prestige to earn one more from a Prestige 3 Mission.

Companies gain prestige as a singular entity. Your character's prestige does not apply to their company, but a company's prestige can carry over to its members. You can read further about this in Companies.

Here are a few ways that prestige can help or be utilized:
Access to crafting materials or special crafters from the Great Bazaar
Access to the Prestige Shop
Access to certain Academy courses
Access to Exotic Pets
Access to Prestige Classes
Your personal quest
Downtime
Downtime is the system through which the player economy and trading of Verum is based upon. Players have the means to make gold, purchase goods, and prepare for future adventures. Each system allows players to do specific actions while waiting for their next missions.

Usually every Sunday at approximately 3 pm CST, an update stream is hosted by Arcadum, also referred to as the weekly reset. During it, many things happen that pertain to the world at large, though what pertains here are the weekly resources awarded - Downtime Days and Crafting Days, which will be stated in the #announcements and #patch-notes channels in the Verum discord. All active players are given these resources regardless of mission participation.

By default, any unspent downtime days and crafting days automatically expire at the next weekly reset. The exception to this is when you're in an RP Locked mission, as detailed in the RP Lock section. The number of days awarded can vary, so it is important to keep track of what given for each week.

Downtime Days
Below is a list of options you can spend your downtime days on, but to do so, you must fill out the Google Form—following the directions stated.

Academies
The system to customize your character's build, covering things such as; skill proficiency retraining, languages, exotic arms and armor training, feat retraining, class level retraining, and more.
You must read the individual system articles to learn how their individual rules, applications, and nuances.
Trading
The systems of trading allow players to trade items and gold between themselves, as well as offer ways to purchase unique magic items and crafting materials. It is important to note that the use of these trading systems are within the context of downtime and cannot be employed during a session.

Player-to-Player Trading
The methods of trading between players occur either directly, or through a middleman, which can be the Great Bazaar World Market or a faction's bank. Direct trading is the traditional method—when you wish to trade something with another player face-to-face. This kind of trade requires you and any other involved players to meet in character and roleplay the exchange. The benefit to this kind of trade is that it is completely within the player's control of how the trade is settled; bargaining, bartering, deception, favors, and so on. However the trade is conducted, it must be approved and logged by a Trading DM. One of the trading players—you must decide amongst yourselves who - must initiate the trade process by making a post in the #trading-log channel in the Verum discord, using the following format:
@Economy @[yourself] is buying/selling/giving/trading [List of items/gold] to @[other players] for [list all terms of the trade]. #[the discord channel you and the other players roleplayed the trade]
Starting Gold: [amount]
Leftover Gold: [amount]
After this initial player makes their post, all other respective players will confirm the terms by making a quick post with the following format:
@[the initial player] confirmed
This indicates that terms are acceptable by all players in the trade, so read the fine print before you post your "confirmed". When this has been done, a Trading DM will react to the "confirmed" posts with a thumbs-up. All players in the trade must wait for this thumbs-up reaction before you can edit your character sheet inventories. The discord channel in which the trade took place must be linked in order for the Trading DM to verify that the trade is legitimate—metagaming will not be tolerated.

Here are example posts when trading:
Player Average Guy, initiating the trade:
@Economy @Average Guy is selling +1 Best Longsword to @Average Girl for 500 gp. #the-party-barge
Starting gold: 800 gp
Leftover gold: 300 gp
Then player Average Girl, confirming the trade:
@Average Guy confirmed
Faction Bank
This type of item exchange is rather straight-forward. Since depositing and withdrawing items from a faction bank are generally instantaneous, one player can deposit an item into their bank for another to withdraw immediately after without having to be in the same location. Obviously, this only works between players in the same faction but is a benefit of the convenience of fluid time. You can read further on factions and faction banks at Factions.
Fluid Time
Verum currently uses fluid time, meaning chronologically tracking events is done softly rather than hard.

Case in point, if you aren't RP locked, you can travel from one side of the continent to the other instantly. If you wanted to add logical steps to your travels, such as taking a carriage halfway and walking the other half, fluid time ignores tese steps. It doesn't matter if, narratively, it should actually take a month to achieve—in fluid time, you arrive at your destination as soon as you want, and the world just accepts it.

The main reason fluid time is used is that the alternative—having to strictly adhere to time like it's a resource to be spent—is much too frustrating and obnoxious for both players and DMs to track.

The only instances fluid time and its implications are not used is during RP Lock. Most times (pun not intended), if you're on an RP locked mission, the time you spend on the mission is what prevents you from leaving it. The DM will explain how events like travel or narrative time-lapses act as a buffer between the mission and what happens outside of it.

If coming to terms between fluid time and logic is difficult to grasp, unless it's so bad that you're actually gaining time (losing time isn't as egregious), then it's best to ignore it. Or, you can blame the deity of time, Raquel, and then ignore it.

Lore
The lore of Verum is very extensive. Arcadum writes out lore on various topics when he has the time. Presently, you can read about the various regions of the continent of Kalkatesh—and details of each.

Below are quick summaries of each location, and links to their respective articles.
Bloodwave Bay
Bloodwave Bay is a place where freedom is paramount and the difference between a pirate and a privateer is what day of the week it may be.
Badlands
The wastes of the Badlands are unforgiving. Death, famine, and disease await any creature that dare to walk its poisoned earth.
Dolten
Dolten is a country hidden in the great expanse of the Abhorrent Arboreal. Her citizens survive amongst some of the most iconic evils darkness has to offer.
Daborak
Daborak is a land of rolling plains, high grass, and the greatest calvary of any realm. All hail the horselords!
Khao
A country with a dual existence - one, a city that floats above the clouds, and the other, the tribes in the misty jungles below.
Krazax
Krazax is the mountain home of the dwarves. The lowlands hold host to many other races who live in the shadow of protection the great mountains provide.
Majital
Majital is a land comprised of desert and scattered oases. Once a vibrant paradise, the land was stricken dry in the war of the Skarab Lords.
Orde
Orde is a country of lush fields and sparkling white towers, where the light is upheld above all else.

VERUM CHARACTER CREATION
In Verum, there are several things different from standard 5e character creation options, as well as new concepts. If you're new to Verum and want to read about creating a character before submitting one, you can skip to Character Alignments. Once you have a character submitted and approved for Verum, then you can come back here to read the Character Sheets section below.

Character Sheets
How to connect your character to The Living World of Verum on World Anvil:
Login to your World Anvil account.
Close to the top left corner of your screen, click Switch to... and click your character’s name in the menu that appears.
Important Note: If you are undergoing this process again due to the known issue with articles not updating with your heroes profile, you will have to create a New hero profile, attach your character sheet to that hero, and have that hero be your active hero for step three.
Click on the invite link that will be sent to you by a staff member.
Creating_CS_for_Verum_2.gif
Don't add a character unless it's been approved by a DM in the Discord, as errant characters are removed. You can read Joining as a Player for more about this.

Filling Out a Character Sheet
Below is an in depth guide to writing the details of your character into your sheet. The character sheet will handle the vast majority of things that pertain to your character mechanically and numerically. Aside from the basic information that has a field on the sheet, this guide covers things that are more thematic or flavor such as:
A description of your character's appearance
Their relationship
Their backstory

Additionally, when editing your sheet, you may notice a handful of tabs at the top, named Arms & Equipment, Creatures & Mounts, Retinue, Spellbook, Possessions & Property; ignore these.

In the first area of the sheet at the top, the fields are fairly straightforward, simply write in the appropriate details. Examples provided are utilizing this writer's own character.
Character Name
Your character's name
Class
Your individual classes
For a single class character, the suggested format is just the class name
If you are multiclassing, it is suggested to separate the individual classes with a + sign, noting the individual class levels for each, and then ending the line with an = sign
Example

Level
Your total character level
Origin
Your character's origin and sub-origin.
It is suggested to put your sub-origin in parentheses after the origin.
Example

Race
Your character's race.
Alignment
Your character's alignment.
Deity
The deity that your character worships.
While your character is free to worship multiple deities as a matter of flavor, you can only gain the Lip Service and Church Boons from one deity, which is the deity you'd name here.
You can read further about deities in Religion.
Stat Array
This is the stat array you chose for your character.
Faction
Your character's faction.
You would note Factionless here if not in a faction
Rank/Position
Your character's rank or position within their faction. If your character is the Chapter Master, Ambassador, or Quartermaster of your Faction, you'd note that here.
Most factions also have individual rank names for their members, which can be viewed in each faction's respective article.
You can read further on this in Factions.
You can ignore this field if you are factionless.
Company
If your character is in a company, you would name it here. Otherwise, you can leave this field blank.
You can read further on this in Companies.
Loyalty
Your character's loyalty to their faction. Loyalty is gained by completing agendas for your faction, gaining 1 loyalty each time. The accumuluation of this loyalty is noted here.
You can read further about this in the Loyalty section of Verumese Factions & Factionless Rules.
Loyalty and Loyalty Benefits are granted when you complete a Long Rest.
You can ignore this field if you're factionless.
Character Alignments
Alignments are the traditional nine alignments, from Lawful Good to Chaotic Evil. However, because of the allowance of PvP in Verum, there is a risk for players who play only to kill other characters and have no care for emotional investment or the consequences of their griefing. While we don't want to disallow evil characters outright since they have their place, they will be controlled.

If you wish to play an evil-aligned character, you must begin in one of the four factions below—you cannot start factionless or any other faction. Note that you are not required to be evil in these factions, only that these are the ones that allow evil characters.
The Linnorm Lords
A faction formed with the return of the Linnorms, an ancient race of primal dragons.
The Ever Eye
A faction formed for the ambitions of Oloken'hai, a god of chaos and madness.
The Crowsworn
A faction formed to carry the creed of Babylon, a god of law and tyranny.
The Forked Tongue
A faction formed with the restoration of a lost art of assassination.
Any evil characters that willingly find themselves not in any of these factions are automatically retired. If a narrative reason forces you out of the faction, you might have options to proceed depending on the circumstances, but these options will be explained to you at that time. You can read further about factions in the Factions section.

Unlike standard 5e, character alignments in Verum may have subtle and potentially impactful weight to them; therefore, you should consider your choice carefully before choosing.

Prime Actions
Prime actions are those that are invariably aligned with a particular force. By performing one of these actions you are furthering that force's influence in the universe, regardless of your reasons.
Law
Fulfilling an Oath
Accepting the providence of Fate
Chaos
Breaking an Oath
Rejecting the providence of Fate
Good
Sacrificing your life or existence in exchange to prevent the death or destruction of another
Defending the Lifestream.
Evil
Destroying a soul or preventing its return to the Lifestream
Severing a soul's silver chord
All Alignments | This action is considered lawful, chaotic, good, and evil simultaneously, which cancel each other out
Upholding the Balance of a Greater Force
Pure Destruction
Undoing the Reckoning

Oaths
Oaths are a divinely powerful and protected interaction characters can partake in and make with other characters, players or NPCs. As such, they come with a certain number of rules by which they work.
An oath needs to be specifically said, be it in or out-of-character, that it is an oath. Otherwise, it is just a promise.
All oaths are promises, but not all promises are oaths.
The difference between an oath and a promise is that an Oath has mechanical and narrative power.
Oaths do not consider intentions, circumstances, or fairness when they're broken.
When making an oath, Divinity must be tagged in the Verum discord within the post declaring the oath.
Oaths can be formally ended as long as both parties are present in a formal setting, and agree to relinquish said oath.
Ability Scores
Ability scores will be determined using stat arrays, in which you will pick one of three arrays available and allocate the scores as you see fit. These stat arrays were created for the purpose of making it easier to balance Verum across all of its games and players. Additional arrays for character creation may become available as the state of Verum calls for it. All other ability score rules from 5e apply as normal.
The Specialist: 17 / 12 / 12 / 11 / 10 / 10
The Mad Man: 15 / 15 / 14 / 11 / 11 / 10
The Razzle Dazzle: 13 / 13 / 13 / 13 / 13 / 13

Martial Skill
A new skill has been added to the standard skill list, called Martial. This check focuses on combat knowledge, relative enemy strength, and similar concepts. This skill is represented by the Wisdom score. All classes may choose Martial with their starting class skill proficiencies.

You can read further about using the Martial skill in Combat.
Races
All races from the books available listed in Approved 5e Books, except those specifically listed (Shadar-kai and Gith), can be played. These races use lore and themes particular to Verum, so lore associated with a race such as elves in D&D 5e does not carry over here. You can read further about the lore of these races in Verum Races.

Some races also have slight changes to their traits, which you can read about in Race Changes.

Verum Races
In addition to the standard 5e races, there are several custom races available just for Verum. Some of these races have prerequisites to play such as being in a certain faction, or fulfilling certain narrative conditions. Some of the other races, such as minotaur and changeling, were created for Verum before they were released in D&D 5e books. Because of this their ability score bonuses and other racial traits will be different. For example the changeling in Verum was released mid-2018, while Eberron (the book with 5e's changeling) was released in November 2019.
Shar'kai
Sprite
Changeling
Satyr
Minotaurs
Dhampir
Red Orc
Human Illithari
Halfling (Songsworn)
The following races cannot be chosen at character creation, but instead your character can become these races upon fulfilling certain conditions.
Revenant
Echo
There is only one documented case of a player character becoming an Echo, so there are no disclosed details on them.

Languages
A language is comprised of its root and Dialect. If you know the root language then you can understand, speak and write all of the dialects of that language to a passable degree, unless stated otherwise. Some dialects are locked for narrative reasons and cannot be chosen. Verum tweaks a few of the base languages listed in 5e, in addition to introducing a few new ones. You can read through the list of languages and their individual dialects and details in Languages.

As of right now there are no mechanical differences between dialects, but there will be in the future. Your dialect will matter even more as actually knowing it can make a subtle but impactful difference. If a race or class grants you a language, you are considered to know the root of that language. If a dialect is not designated this way, you may choose one.

Age
In Verum, you cannot play a character that is underage for the race, you may only play adults. For example, Elves reach adulthood at the age of 100, so you cannot play elves that are younger than 100 years.

Classes
All classes and their subclasses from Approved 5e Books are allowed. The Ranger (Revised) from Unearthed Arcana is used instead of from the Player's Handbook. Furthermore, the Beast Conclave subclass has been significantly rebalanced for Verum (this is listed below in Verum Classes under Ranger. Other classes have slight changes, which you can read about in Class Changes.

Hit Points
Your starting hit points at level 1 is calculated based on the maximum amount of your class’ hit die plus your constitution modifier and any modifiers from feats, origins, or items as applicable. For example, a level 1 wizard that uses a D6 hit die would have 6 hit points before adding any relevant modifiers.

Every time you level up after level 1, you gain an additional number of hit points equal to the class’ hit die average, (rounded up) adding your constitution modifier then any other modifiers such as from feats, origins, or items as appropriate.
D6 = 4
D8 = 5
D10 = 6
D12 = 7

Starting Equipment
You begin play with your respective class' Starting Equipment, and you cannot choose the alternative GP option. Instead, any wealth you'd start with comes from your chosen faction, or from a few specific origins. Thus, the factionless by default does not start with any wealth. However, you do always start with a set of Common Clothes.

You can further read about factions in Factions and origins in Origins.

Verum Classes
Special Verumese subclasses and prestige classes are available for players. Some have certain requirements to be able to be chosen.

Verum also reintroduces the concept of Prestige Classes, as seen in classic D&D editions, which are stand-alone class expansions that focus your character's style further than even subclasses. Rather than taking levels in these prestige classes, they instead replace your ASIs as you would gain them with new class features. You can read further regarding this in Prestige Classes.

Origins
Origins are an important choice for your character, since they entail what has shaped them to be who they are just before the start of their adventuring life. They depict what skills and abilities were gained as your character grew into adulthood. Origins replace backgrounds as a character feature, but backstories can still potentially play a role later in your character's life. You can further read about this in Backstory.

Origins are categorized by regions of Verum, which further detail suborigins from each region. While you are not necessarily born in these regions, they are what you would call home. Some races may be restricted to certain origins.

You can find a complete list of origins and suborigins in Origins.
Factions
Factions are organizations in Verum run by players and important NPCs. They are run through a democratic player-based hierarchy and provide a structure through which players can interact with the world. Each is a unique entity which provides, benefits for joining at player creation including tool proficiencies, additional starting equipment, and potentially greater options.

When you create your character you can choose to either start in a faction or be factionless. You can further read about faction rules in Verumese Factions & Factionless Rules. You can also find a complete list of available factions and their individual articles in Faction Category.

As mentioned in Character Alignments, evil characters are restricted to beginning play in one of four determined factions: the Linnorm Lords, the Ever Eye, the Crowsworn, and the Forked Tongue.
Companies
Companies are like semi-factions. They are formed by those who wish to adventure together under a common cause. ns. They are formed by those who wish to adventure together under a common cause. There are missions specifically tailored for companies that a company's members are automatically slotted to attend. Such missions contrast with the often random scheduling of players for normal missions. Companies are one of the very few ways for players to create their own factions if the company is properly developed and supported.

Companies are initially created by players with some investments and stipulations. You can read further about companies and how to make one in Company Rules, and find a list of companies created by players in Companies Category.
Religion
Verum is host to completely customized deities and pantheons, each with their own ideals and ambitions. You can find a complete list of available deities to worship in Divinity.

Whenever you choose a deity to follow you receive the Lip Service benefit of that deity, which is generally a free skill proficiency. If you have the option to choose, your choice is locked-in once made and cannot be changed as long as you worship that deity. If your character has at least 1 level in cleric or paladin, you also gain the respective ability score bonus noted under Church Boon.

You can change which god you worship, and thus the respective lip service and church boon benefits, at any time. This may result in in-character consequences. If you do wish to worship a different deity, you must make a roleplaying post in the discord tagging Divinity, notifying them who you are switching your worship to. The post can be as simple or complex as you want, though it is encouraged to elaborate on why you are switching deities.

Domains
When playing as a cleric, you can only choose from the domains associated with the deity your character worships. You may be a cleric that does not worship a deity and choose any domain you want, but you do not benefit from any lip service or church boon.

In addition to the domains from available 5e books, there are 21 new domains available for you to choose from—which you can find in Cleric.
Backstory
There is no doubt that backstory is one of the most fun aspects of creating a character. You are encouraged to create a backstory to pair with your character, but keep in mind very important points:
Your backstory by default is not canon in the world.
This means any story you imagine leading up to your character gaining their first level in a class and starting as an adventurer, has not actually happened within Verum. While you are free to reference your backstory in-character for narrative reasons, you cannot gain any mechanical benefits nor influence Verum's culture with it—directly or indirectly. This is to say that nothing your character has done, who they are related to, or any other aspect of their lives can have an impact on the game.
The only facet of your background that has any actual weight is your origin.
Your backstory may become canonical, but only through personal quests. This is available to players who have achieved 4 Prestige, as described in Downtime.

Death
The archetypical adversary for D&D players, death occurs most ordinarily in a game session where the players are unfortunate or brash enough to be caught in a deadly situation.

In standard D&D the presence of magic, especially at higher levels of play, can make character death trivial. In order to ensure there is weight behind your character's actions and the resulting consequences, it is much more difficult to resurrect the dead in Verum. Below are a few more points to keep in mind when your character dies:
Regardless of how or where they die, the first step is to make sure the DMs are aware. Though, in a situation where death is occurring, one is likely involved already.
Their inventory may be salvaged by others who are aware and present at the moment of death.
Wills are not mechanically supported in Verum, as it leaves temptation for people to metagame and takes advantage of it. Anything in your character's possession that is retrieved and returned belongs to their faction, not their spouse or children.
If the body and items are unable to be retrieved after death then they are considered gone and may only be found as loot on other missions.
Only other player characters or in-world events can resurrect a dead character. Any attempts to recover your old characters from death with any of your new characters will be considered metagaming.
Instant Death
The Instant Death rule found on page 197 of the D&D 5e Player's Handbook is ignored; your character can no longer be killed instantly through massive damage.

Your character can still instantly die by other means of Certain Death - a phrase used to categorize scenarios in which there are no, or trivially low, chances of survival—such as falling from extremely high elevations or being plane-shifted to an inhospitable dimension with no recourse. Keep in mind that certain death scenarios are not limited to game sessions; you can just as easily die roleplaying in Verum if you're in the wrong place at the wrong time.
